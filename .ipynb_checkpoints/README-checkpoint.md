# python-challenge
This Python script  analyzes the financial records of your company using the financial dataset in the budget_data.csv file. This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. The following are calculated:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period
* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period <br>
The results are printed in the terminal, and an output .csv file is also generated.
